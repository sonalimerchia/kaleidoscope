Kaleidoscope maker.

This program allows the user to draw on the screen and have the contents of 
the drawing repeated multiple times over around a circle as if viewing through
a kaleidoscope. The example above is divided into six of these sectors The features 
of the program will allow the user to change brush size, the color they are drawing 
with, the number of sectors, click undo, and it save the image to a file. While 
editing the user can draw in any sector and it will automatically reflect across 
all sectors of the circle.

Personally I enjoy art and this form of editor is one I've never been able to find
a satisfactory program for. Drawing mandalas requires a lot of attention to symmetry
so this might be helpful for me to draw up quick sketches in the future for when
I have to design rangolis for future years. I made a program similar to BasicApp
in java back in sophomore year of high school so I have a little experience with 
sketchup software.

By the end of week 1 I will have the basic math component of the problem done such
that (with no special features), drawing will result in the image being reflected
into other sectors. This version will not be able to switch colors, change brush size,
or really much other than the basic structure of the kaleidoscope maker. During 
week 2 I will integrate saving the image to a file and recalibrating the image 
when the user tries to switch the number of sectors. During week 3 I will integrate 
features like undo, color changing and customization, and saving. 

Stretch goals for this project could be loading an image into the program or 
allowing some lines to be translucent so multiple layers are visible.
